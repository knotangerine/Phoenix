# PHOENIX - A Personal Entertainment Guide

This is a project that I created just for fun to revise and implement all the skills I learned in the first semester of my CS degree.

Have you ever struggled to choose what film you're going to watch next or what album you're going to listen to or what's the next book you're going to read?

Phoenix helps you decide that by giving you recommendations for movies, tv shows, albums, books and games from a collection of personally curated lists. 




## Features - 

- Films

## Installation

You can easily run this program for yourself by downloading the .py files from the repository and copying & pasting them into your own IDE's. The lists are customizable, so if you'd like to add new entries, please feel free to do so!
